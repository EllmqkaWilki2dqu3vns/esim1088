In addition to eSIMs, there are also **physical SIM cards** available for those who prefer traditional methods. These come in various types, including prepaid and postpaid options, offering flexibility depending on your usage patterns. Prepaid SIMs are ideal for short-term visitors who want to control their spending, while postpaid plans might suit longer-term residents or frequent travelers who need more extensive coverage.
